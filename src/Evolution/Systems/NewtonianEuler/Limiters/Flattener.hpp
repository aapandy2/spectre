/// \brief Scale a NewtonianEuler solution around its mean to remove pointwise
/// positivity violations.
///
/// If the solution has points with negative density, scales the solution
/// to make these points positive again. For each component \f$u\f$ of the
/// solution, the scaling takes the form
/// \f$u \to \bar{u} + \theta (u - \bar{u})\f$,
/// where \f$\bar{u}\f$ is the cell-average value of \f$u\f$, and \f$\theta\f$
/// is a factor less than 1, chosen to restore positive density.
/// The cell averages in this implementation are computed in inertial
/// coordinates, so the flattener is conservative even on deformed grids.
///
/// A scaling of this form used to restore positivity is usually called a
/// flattener (we use this name) or a bounds-preserving filter. Note that the
/// scaling approach only works if the cell-averaged solution is itself
/// physical, in other words, if the cell-averaged density is positive.
///
/// After checking for (and correcting) negative densities, if the equation of
/// state is two-dimensional, then the pressure is also checked for positivity.
/// If negative pressures are found, each solution component is set to its mean
/// (this is equivalent to \f$\theta = 0\f$ in the scaling form above).
/// In principle, a less aggressive scaling could be used, but solving for the
/// correct \f$\theta\f$ in this case is more involved.
