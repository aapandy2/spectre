# SpECTRE Copy

Changes:
- Everything is put in one directory for easier compilation.
- pragma omp are commented out in sharp.c and sharp_legendre_roots.c
- Factor m=0 iteration out of loop in `if (spin==0)` of `sharp_Ylmgen_init`
  in `sharp_ylmgen_c.c` in order to avoid FPE with Clang. Clang optimizes too
  aggressively and always evaluates the `1./gen->root[m]` in the ternary
  `(m==0) ? 0. : 1./gen->root[m];`.

# Development has moved

This repository has been archived and is only kept so that packages depending on
it have a cacnonical place to download the last version.

For new projects using spherical harmonic transforms we recommend to use
- `libsharp2` (https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/mtr/libsharp) if you need MPI
  functionality, or
- the `sht` component of https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/mtr/ducc if your project
  is written in modern C++ or Python, and you don't need MPI support within
  the transforms.

Both of the above libraries are successors to `libsharp` which are
significantly faster than the last `libsharp` version available here. Since the
switch to the new algorithms required slight changes to the API, we decided to
develop them in separate repositories and keep the original `libsharp`
repository unchanged.


# Libsharp

*IMPORTANT NOTE*: It appears that the default branch upon cloning from
github.com/dagss/libsharp was an outdated 'dagss' branch instead of
the 'master' branch. To get the latest copy,
please do `git checkout master; git pull`. New clones are no longer affected.

## Compilation

GNU make is required for compilation.

Libsharp compilation has been successfully tested with GNU and Intel compilers.
When using gcc, version 4.x is required [1].
Since libsharp was written in standard C99, other compilers should work fine,
but SSE2/AVX support will most likely be deactivated.

If you obtained libsharp directly from the git repository, you will also
need a copy of the GNU autotools. In this case, run "autoconf" in libsharp's
main directory before any other steps.
For libsharp releases distributed as a .tar.gz file, this step is not necessary.

Afterwards, simply run "./configure"; if this fails, please refer to the output
of "./configure --help" for additional hints and, if necessary, provide
additional flags to the configure script.
Once the script finishes successfully, run "make"
(or "gmake"). This should install the compilation products in the
subdirectory "auto/".

Documentation can be created by the command "(g)make doc".
However this requires the doxygen application to be installed
on your system.
The documentation will be created in the subdirectory doc/.


[1] Some versions of the gcc 4.4.x release series contain a bug which causes
the compiler to crash during libsharp compilation. This appears to be fixed
in the gcc 4.4.7 release. It is possible to work around this problem by adding
the compiler flag "-fno-tree-fre" after the other optimization flags - the
configure script should do this automatically.


ls_fft description:

This package is intended to calculate one-dimensional real or complex FFTs
with high accuracy and good efficiency even for lengths containing large
prime factors.
The code is written in C, but a Fortran wrapper exists as well.

Before any FFT is executed, a plan must be generated for it. Plan creation
is designed to be fast, so that there is no significant overhead if the
plan is only used once or a few times.

The main component of the code is based on Paul N. Swarztrauber's FFTPACK in the
double precision incarnation by Hugh C. Pumphrey
(http://www.netlib.org/fftpack/dp.tgz).

I replaced the iterative sine and cosine calculations in radfg() and radbg()
by an exact calculation, which slightly improves the transform accuracy for
real FFTs with lengths containing large prime factors.

Since FFTPACK becomes quite slow for FFT lengths with large prime factors
(in the worst case of prime lengths it reaches O(n*n) complexity), I
implemented Bluestein's algorithm, which computes a FFT of length n by
several FFTs of length n2>=2*n-1 and a convolution. Since n2 can be chosen
to be highly composite, this algorithm is more efficient if n has large
prime factors. The longer FFTs themselves are then computed using the FFTPACK
routines.
Bluestein's algorithm was implemented according to the description at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluestein's_FFT_algorithm.

Thread-safety:
All routines can be called concurrently; all information needed by ls_fft
is stored in the plan variable. However, using the same plan variable on
multiple threads simultaneously is not supported and will lead to data
corruption.
